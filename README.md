# Motivation :boom:

This project was created for the complete safety of its user, but why create another chat? The well-known messenger Telegram is **NOT** secure.

### Why is Telegram insecure?

1. Telegram Chats **Aren't** End-to-End Encrypted by Default

Telegram does encrypt your messages as they travel between your device and the Telegram server. However, these messages sit on the server so you can access them from multiple devices. A breach of Telegram's servers could thus result in your **messages being exposed**. Security chat also stores your messages on the server, but **only you can decrypt your messages**!

2. Telegram Collects Your Contact Data

Telegram collects basic data about the **contacts** on **your phone**. It is very dangerous! Only **your nickname** is required to register with the Security chat.

3. Telegram is **not** open source

Official Telegram clients are open source, while the server is **closed-sourced** and **proprietary**. The community **cannot check** servers for **vulnerabilities** and **collect data**.

4. Telegram uses C++

C++ is a highly unsafe programming language. The abundance of strange syntactic constructions, a lot of undefined behaviors makes it extremely unsafe for creating cryptographic programs // TODO

5. Telegram is [vulnerable](https://www.gamingdeputy.com/the-fsb-learned-to-track-the-traffic-of-telegram-whatsapp-and-signal/) and has ties to the [government](https://restoreprivacy.com/telegram-sharing-user-data/) and [corporation](https://caliber.az/en/post/89269/)
